# Gene Expression analysis from RNA-Seq database

We will use RNA-Seq data to study the expression levels of genes in the head and testes of D. 
melanogaster. Since RNA-Seq data are usually huge and thus, difficult to handle, we will use only a
subset of data corresponds to the X chromosome.

We will base on the experiment E-MTAB-493 which retrieves datas for Drosophila genome, from the arrayexpress website.

We will use bowtie2 to map reads to the reference,  get the gene and transcript expression levels with cufflinks and
 run cuffmerge to merge the results of cufflinks in a unified model. We will finally Run 
 cuffdiff and get the differentially expressed genes
